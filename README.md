# @buccaneerai/stt-deepgram
> üëÇ An RxJS operator for real-time speech-to-text (STT/S2T) streaming using the Deepgram speech-to-text API.

## Installation
This is a private package. It requires setting up access in your npm config.

```bash
yarn add @buccaneerai/stt-deepgram
```

‚ö†Ô∏è To run the Deepgram transcription pipeline, you will need to provide a deepgram username and password.

‚ö†Ô∏è node.js only. This has not been tested on Browsers but it might be possible to make it work.  If you get it working, please make a PR!

## API

### `toDeepgram`
Stream audio speech data to transcription service via WebSocket and get transcripts back:
```js
import {map} from 'rxjs/operators';
import {toDeepgram} from '@buccaneerai/stt-deepgram';

// The pipeline can take a stream of audio chunks encoded as 
// LINEAR16 (PCM encoded as 16-bit integers) in the form of a Buffer
const buffer$ = pcmChunkEncodedAs16BitIntegers$.pipe(
  map(chunk => Buffer.from(chunk, 'base64')),
  toDeepgram({
    username: process.env.DEEPGRAM_USERNAME,
    password: process.env.DEEPGRAM_PASSWORD,
  })
);
buffer$.subscribe(console.log); // log transcript output
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Pay attention to the endcoding of the audio data.  The operator only accepts PCM data encoded as 16-bit integers. For example, LINEAR16 encoding usually works.
